    <span class='first-letter'>I</span>t requires a meeting of the minds between logical/critical perspective and blue sky thinking where there are no constraints. I’ve built three successful businesses in the past few years, all three of which I am equally passionate about and all three of which cater to different aspects of my personality. My first, Zoraab, is an online retailer and subscription service for men’s socks and underwear. My second business Mint Socks, is our own line of socks designed and developed in-house with inspiration drawn from the greatest street artists of our time. Both Zoraab and Mint Socks have seen considerable success and we’ve been able to build it from nothing into businesses that generate 7 figures in revenue. My most recent company, The Fresh, we’ve just launched and is a full service web design and development agency where we work with passionate start-ups in launching their vision.

    I believe that a business should share the same properties as a good computer application, where its purpose is singular and focused and is able to launch quickly and often. It should not be everything to everyone and it certainly should not take years to launch. The greatest business rose to success by doing one thing and doing it well and stayed lean. It’s when you introduce too many additional services and items where the purpose and pereception becomes cloudy and the business model becames bloated. This is the philosophy that I’ve followed in launching my past 3 businesses and will most likely be the framework under which I launch all my future ventures.
