The best code is not written in a dark basement somewhere by a hacker who pulled an all nighter just to make an app work by brute force. Good code is carefully planned and well thought out in a modular fashion that uses inventive solutions to solve complex problems so it can endure and last through time and be built upon. These are the standards I hold myself to in creating all of my projects. I have been coding on and off since the MySpace days of yesteryear but I’ve been pursuing it seriously for the past 4 years. I’ve gone through the infamously intense DevBootcamp out in San Francisco, and I have worked under some talented and seasoned developers through apprenticeships.  I am a full stack developer, which means that I code both the front end (HTML/CSS) and back end (primarily Ruby on Rails). I’ve been at this for years now and everyday I seek to grow as a developer both through teaching beginners (at General Assembly and DevBootcamp), as well as learning more about the craft from the experts.
